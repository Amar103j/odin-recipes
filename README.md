# Odin Recipes

## Introduction

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and focuses on building a basic recipe website using HTML. The goal is to create a simple webpage that showcases a collection of recipes, each with its own page containing ingredients and cooking instructions.

By completing this project, I aim to demonstrate and strengthen the following skills:

- Structuring content using semantic HTML
- Linking multiple web pages together
- Organizing a project using proper file structure and naming conventions
- Practicing Git and GitHub for version control

This project serves as a foundation for future web development by reinforcing the core principles of building static websites.
